## Theory

### 1. Why use tight upper bounds in Big-Oh notation?

### For the following questions, check O for True or X for False.

#### 2. 64-bit and 32-bit memory ranges are different. (O/X)

#### 3. The member function designated as protected in the class is accessible in the child class. (O/X)

#### 4. In class, the friend function is a member function. (O/X)

#### 5. Queue Is LIFO? (O/X)

#### 6. Stack Is FIFO? (O/X)

### 7. Draw a binary tree that satisfies the following conditions.

1. Traversing the tree as preorder is `1 2 4 8 9 5 10 11 3 6 12 13 7 14 15`.
2. Traversing the tree as inorder is `8 4 9 2 10 5 11 1 12 6 13 3 14 7 15`.

### 8. Secondary clustering occurs when square exploration is applied to hashtables.

### 9. Using the character distribution given below to draw step-by-step trie structure forming the Huffman code.

Character Distribution:

| Char | Freq |
| ---- | ---- |
| a    | 10   |
| b    | 10   |
| c    | 35   |
| d    | 40   |
| f    | 55   |

### 10. Which are in the Big-Ω(n^2) category?

1. 4n^6
2. 2^n+4n
3. log(log(n))
4. 4n+log(n)
5. 7n+10
6. 4n^2
7. 6n^2+100
8. log(log(n))+log(n)
9. log(n)
10. 4n^3+3n^2
11. 4n
12. n^3

### 11. Solve the problem below about the tree.

#### 1. Draw the step of adding nodes to the Binary Tree, 2-3 Tree, 2-3-4 Tree, and Red-Black Tree step by step when the numbers come in the following order.

Input: 50, 60, 40, 30, 10, 20

#### 2. Draw the process step by step when you delete 60 from 2-3 Tree.

#### 3. Find the height of each tree

### 12. Prove why the height of the heap tree is `O(log n)`.

### 13. Draw the shape of hash table when you put `S={18,41,23,44,57,32,31,73}` through a hash function with `h(k)=k mod N` into the table with N(N=13) buckets. (where `d(k) = 7 - (k mod 7)`)
